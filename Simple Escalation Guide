Based on my previous encounters with Google Cybersecurity and TryHackMe SOC L1 Alert Reporting Room

Examples of when alerts should be escalated:

1. There is an indicator or an attack that needs to be immediately addressed.
2. When remediation actions fall outside assigned access levels or role-based permissions.
3. Communication is required with law enforcement, customers, or higher levels of leadership.
4. When I don't fully understand an alert and need help from more senior analyst.
