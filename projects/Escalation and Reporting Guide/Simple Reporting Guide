Alert reporting is an important part of SOC. Below are some reminders and good practices when it comes to reporting alerts.

USE the 5 W's:

Who: Which user logs in, runs the command, or downloads the file
What: What exact action or event sequence was performed
When: When exactly did the suspicious activity start and ended
Where: Which device, IP, or website was involved in the alert
Why: The most important W, the reasoning for your final verdict
