# Cybersecurity Portfolio – Kenny Albert

Welcome. This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity projects and practical lab work, focused on building real-world security engineering and SOC skills.

## Focus Areas

- Security Operations (SOC)
- Network discovery & asset visibility
- Log analysis & incident response
- Detection engineering & automation
- Containerized security tooling

---

## Projects

### Incident Escalation & Reporting Guide

A structured guide outlining how security incidents are classified, escalated, and documented within a SOC environment.  
Covers severity levels, escalation triggers, stakeholder communication, and reporting standards.  
Designed to reflect real-world incident response workflow and operational discipline.



### Net Scan Logger
A Docker-based network discovery automation tool written in Bash.

- Subnet argument handling with defaults
- Timestamped logging for historical tracking
- Defensive scripting practices (`set -euo pipefail`)
- Controlled execution with timeout handling
- Containerized Nmap scanning

## Philosophy

I focus on building small, practical security tools that demonstrate:

- Infrastructure awareness
- Repeatable automation
- Defensive engineering practices
- Clear documentation

Each project in this repository is designed to reflect real-world workflows used in security operations and network reconnaissance.
